## What is Unix?

  Unix is a portable, multitasking, multiuser, time-sharing 
  operating system OS).
 
  The Unix opearting system is a set of programs that act as a
  link between the computer and the user.
 
  Unix was originally deveploped in 1969 by a group of 
  employees at AT&T.
 
  Unix was first programmed in assembly language but was 
  reprogrammed in C in 1973.

## Operating System
![Operating System](https://github.com/aniketchavan2211/Journey-start-from-here/blob/master/Images/operating-system.png)
  The programs that assign the system resources and coordinate
  all the details of the computer's internal is called the
  operating system or the kernal.

## Design Of Unix

 Unix consists of four basics flavours:
 - Kernel
 - Shell
 - Commands and Utilities
 - Files Directiories

### What is a Kernel?

 > The kernel is the heart of the operating system.
 >
 > It interacts with the hardware.
 >
 > The kernel manages other tasks like memory management, task
 > schedduling, and file management.
 >
 > The Computer Programs that allocate the system resource and 
 > coordinate all the details of the computer's internals is
 > is called the operating system or the kernal. 
 >
 > Users communicate with the OS through a program called the Shell.

### What is a Shell?
![Shell script file](https://github.com/aniketchavan2211/Journey-start-from-here/blob/master/Images/sh.png)
 > The shell is the utility that processes your requests.
 > Basically, when you type in a command, the shell interprets 
 > the command and calls the program that you want.
 > 
 > C shell, Bourne shell and korn shell are the most famous shells
 > which are available with most of the Unix variants.
 >
 > The Shell is a Command Line Interpreter.It translates 
 > commands entered by the user and converts them into a 
 > language that is understood by the kernal.

### What is a Shell Script?

 >
 > The Basic concept of a shell script is a list of commands.
 > which are listed in the order of execution. A good shell
 > script will have comments preceded by # sign, describing the
 > steps.

### Types of Shell
 
   - C Shell (csh)
    Ideal for learners comfortable with the C programming 
    language.Mostly Network Admins use this shell.
 
   - Korn Shell (ksh)
    This highly interactive shell is generally used to automate
    a wide variety of operating system and system adminstrative 
    tasks.

   - Bourne Shell (sh) or Bourne Again Shell (bash)
    Versatile and easy to learn, most widely taught and learnt 
    shell for scripting and interfacing purposes.
 
   - Z Shell (zsh)
    The Z shell is a Unix shell that can be used as an 
    interactive login shell and as a command interpreter for 
    shell scripting.

   - Tenex Shell (tcsh) 
    Tcsh offers multiple options, including a command-line 
    editor, job control, spellcheck support, configurable 
    command-line completion, a modernized history mechanism, 
    and more.

   - Friendly Interactive Shell (fish)
    Fish includes various options, such as syntax highlighting, 
    fancy tab completion, auto-complete suggestions, and more.

### Commands and Utilities

  Like the word, "commands" itself says you have to follow
  as per the given instructions.
 
  There are various commands and utilities which you can make
  use of in your days to days activities.
 
  cp, mv, cat and grep, etc are a few examples of commands and
  utilities.

### Files and Directories

  We all know the use of files an directories, we use it to store
  data according to their type.
  
  All files are then organised into directories.
  
  These directories are further organised into a tree-like
  structure called the filesystem.

## Shell Programming 

 Shell is an environment in which we can run our commands, 
 programs, and shell scripts.

 Shell provides you with an interface to the Unix System.

 The interface means a device or program enabling a user to 
 communicate with a computer.

 Shell gathers input from you and executes programs based on 
 that input.
 
 When a program finishes executing, it displays that program's 
 output.

 We can run our commands, programs.

 Shell issues a prompt '$' which is called a command prompt.
 
 You can type your commands when the '$' prompt is displayed.
 
 The shell reads inputs after you press Enter Key

 `$date`

 "date" command prints current date and time on console/output
 or screen.

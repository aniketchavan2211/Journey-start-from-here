 
## Batch Scripting
 
 Batch Scripting consists of a series of 
 commands to be executed by the command-line 
 interpreter, stored in a plain text file. 
 It is not commonly used as a programming 
 language and so it is not commonly practiced
 and is not trending but its control and 
 dominance in the Windows environment can 
 never be neglected. Almost every task and 
 every action can be performed and executed 
 by a simple sequence of commands typed on 
 the Windows Command Prompt.

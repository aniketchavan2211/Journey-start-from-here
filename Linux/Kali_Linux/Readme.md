## Terminologies
  `Kernel` : The kernel is a computer program
    that is the core of a computer's operating
    systems with complete controls over 
    everything in the system,It manages 
    following resources of the Linux like file
    management, Process management, I/O 
    mangement , Memory management, Device 
    mangement.
  
  `Shell` : A shell is special user program
    which provide in interface to user to use
    operating system services.Shell accepts 
    human readable commands from user and convert
    them into something which kernel can 
    understand. It is can command language
    interpreter that execute commands read 
    from input devices such as keyboard 
    from files. Shell gets started when the 
    user logs in or start the terminal.

   `Terminal` : We can say the terminal is a
     dumb thing so it does not know what to
     do with the inputs, so it needs another
     program to process it. The terminal is 
     a program that provides the user with
     a simple command-line interface.

   `Console` : In the case of window OS, the 
     "console" performs the same operation performed
     by the terminal so we can say for Windows
     OS, the console is the alias name for 
     the terminal.

   `Shell Scripting` : As shell can also take 
     commands as input form file we can write 
     these command in a file and can execute 
     them in shell to avoid this respective work.
     These files are called shell scripts or 
     Shell Programs. Shell script are similar
     to the batch file in MS-DOS, Each shell script
     is saved with `.sh` file extension eg: `myscript.sh`

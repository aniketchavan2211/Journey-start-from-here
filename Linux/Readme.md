# Linux

 Linux is a free, open-source, and community-developed operating
 system.
 
 Linux is one of the few open-source systems where the kernel 
 isrresponsible for establishing the connection between the
 computer hardware and the operating system software.

 Linux is a kernel upon.which many operating system, such as Ubuntu
 and Arch Linux, are built.

 Behind every application, on a computer, there is an operating
 system that allows you to use the hardware.

 In 1991, Linus Torvalds began creating Linux as a hobby.

 While in college, Linus wanted to create a version of the MINIX
 operating system that would be based or Unix principles and
 design. Linus hardware support and licensing have made
 Linux a tremendous success.a
 
 It powers 90% of the world's server and is the basis of Google's
 popular Andriod Operating System.


## Interaction with Linux

  A user can interact with Linux either using a (graphical interface
  or using the command line interface.

  The command line is an interesting beast, and if you're not used
  our before, it can be a bit daunting: Don't worry, with a bit
  of practice you'll soon come to see it as your friend.

  What is a Command Line Interface (CLI) A command line, or
  terminal, is a text-based interface to the system. You
  can enter commands by trying them on the keyword and results
  will be returned in the form of text too.

## Why Linux ?

 Although Linux offers high security and stability,
 users initially disliked the interface because
 it was not very user-friendly. But this was 
 not the case for them.

 With regular updates and feedback from users,
 Linux become much more appealing.

 Every supercomputer runs on Linux!, Linux
 runs all 500 of the world's fastest supercomputers.
 It's a default choice when it comes to supercomputers.

 Linux is everywhere!

 There are many reasons why Linux is so popular
 among different fields. Here are a few,

 - **It's Free**:There is no cost for using Linux 
 OS (Desktop or Server distro) and related 
 applications.
 - **More Choice**: You can't beat Linux here.
 There are over 600 Linux distros and about 500
 in active development.

 - **Developers Friend**: Developers love Linux.
 It supports almost all the major programming
 languages you can think of. A rich set of native
 libraries, a powerful and far better Linux 
 terminal than Windows CLI.

## Interaction with Linux

  A user can interact with Linux either using a (graphical interface
  or using the command line interface.

  The command line is an interesting beast, and if you're not used
  our before, it can be a bit daunting: Don't worry, with a bit
  of practice you'll soon come to see it as your friend.

  terminal, is a text-based interface to the system. You
  can enter commands by trying them on the keyword and results
  will be returned in the form of text too.

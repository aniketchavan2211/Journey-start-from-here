## Python Basics

### Location Data
 Let's use varaibles to record data points about
 a traveler's location as part of a journaling
 app 

 Snippet :
 ```python 
 #!/bin/python 

 country = "USA"
 state = "Florida"
 city = "Miami"
 continent = "North America"
 ```

### Smart Light Switch 
 Let's create a smart light switch that switches
 the lights off it's daytime and on if it's nightmare.

 Snippet :
 ```python
 #!/bin/python
 #Night Time

 print ("Night Time")
 is_day = False
 lights_on = not is_day

 print ("Daytime?")
 print (is_day)

 print ("Light_on?")
 print (lights_on)

 #Day Time

 print ("Day Time")

 is_day = True
 lights_on = not is_day

 print ("Daytime?")
 print (is_day)

 print ("Light_on?")
 print (lights_on)
 ```
